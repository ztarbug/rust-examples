# OpenCV example
OpenCV is powerful image library written in C++. This example shows how to use this lib from Rust. 

## Build
Please note, that you need to have OpenCV on your system. How to install that, please use a search engine to look for your system. On Ubuntu this did the trick:

    apt install libopencv-dev

After that it is the usual

    cargo build

This tool demonstrates a number of things and you need to specify command as a parameter like so:

    cargo run -- save
    cargo run -- display

TODO describe each function.
